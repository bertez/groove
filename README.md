groove
======

Time tracking app developed by A navalla suÃ­za using the superheroic Angular JS javascript framework and the not least awesome FOL PHP microframework. It also uses MySQL for data persistence and Bootstrap for the UI.


Installation
------------

1. Clone this repository in grooveApp folder

```
$ git clone git@github.com:bertez/groove.git grooveApp
```

2. Enter in the folder repository and install fol framework in the folder "api" (you need composer):

```
$ cd grooveApp
$ composer create-project fol/fol api
```

3. Once fol is installed, you need to install the app with the rest api:

```
$ cd api
$ composer require fol/rest
```

4. Then, edit the index.php file to register the installed app and execute it:

```php
use Fol\Loader;

include('bootstrap.php');

//Register the app here
Loader::registerNamespace('Apps\\Rest', BASE_PATH.'/rest');

//Handle the request and send the response
$app = new Apps\Rest\App;
$app()->send();
```

5. Now, you need a mysql database. Edit the config/database.example.php file with your database configuration and save (or rename) as database.php.
6. Create the database using the db.sql file located in the repository root.

```
$ cd ../..
$ mysql -u your-user -p < db.sql
```

7. Open the app in your browser (http://localhost/grooveApp) and enjoy.
